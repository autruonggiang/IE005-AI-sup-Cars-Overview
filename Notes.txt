(Regulations for the 1st semester, academic year 2021-2022)

Regarding the issue of the number of pages specified for reports, there are some notes as follows:

Page format is A4.
The number of pages should not exceed 2 pages (summary report) and 5 pages (final report), however, a margin of error of up to 2 pages is acceptable.
The specified number of pages does not include the cover page.

Thank you, everyone.
